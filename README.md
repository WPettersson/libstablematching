[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WPettersson/libstablematching.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WPettersson/libstablematching)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/WPettersson/libstablematching/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/WPettersson/libstablematching)

This software creates random SMTI instances, and produces various types of
encodings for said instance for use in benchmarking various types of solvers.
For a background on what SMTI is, see the introduction in

lists. M. Delorme, S. Garc√≠a, J. Gondzio, J. Kalcsics, D. Manlove, W.

This software currently supports the following problem types:

 * SAT
 * Weighted Pseudo MaxSAT
 * Pseudo Boolean Optimisation
 * Integer Programming Optimisation

Next steps might include:

 * Pseudo Boolean SAT

## Features

### Dummy variables

The two SAT encodings check for a complete stable matching. To
check for a largest-size stable matching, one can add dummy agents using
SMTI::add_dummy(). This adds one dummy agent to either side, each of which
finds all other agents equally acceptable. If adding *n-1* dummy agents results
in an unsatisfiable instance, but adding *n* dummy variables makes the
instances satisfiable, then the largest size stable matching has *n* unmatched
agents.



## Encoding types

### SAT

The produced file is encoded in [DIMACS cnf](http://www.domagoj-babic.com/uploads/ResearchProjects/Spear/dimacs-cnf.pdf).
This encoding only looks for a stable matching, not a maximum-sized one.

### Weighted Pseudo MaxSAT

The produced file is encoded in a similar DIMACS form (see
[http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/requirements/](http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/requirements/)).


### Pseudo Boolean Optimisation

This creates files in the [OPB](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB10/format.pdf) format.
The objective in such an encoding is to minimise the number of agents who are
not matched.


### Minizinc Format

This creates a file suitable for use with [Minizinc](https://www.minizinc.org/), with an optional parameter to toggle between either find any stable matching or find a largest-size stable matching.

### Integer programming optimisation

Currently the IP is directly solved with [Symphony](https://coin-or.github.io/SYMPHONY/).
The basic model is taken from [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.017) (lines (1) through (5)). Stability constraint merging (as described in [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.017)) is also supported as an option.
The solver is accessed via OsiSolverInterface, so adaptations to other solvers should not be too difficult.
