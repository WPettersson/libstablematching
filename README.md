# SMTI encoder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WPettersson/smti-encoder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WPettersson/smti-encoder)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/WPettersson/smti-encoder/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/WPettersson/smti-encoder)

This software creates random SMTI instances, and produces various types of
encodings for said instance for use in benchmarking various types of solvers.
For a background on what SMTI is, see the introduction in

This software currently supports the following problem types:

 * SAT
 * Weighted Pseudo MaxSAT
 * Pseudo Boolean Optimisation
 * Integer Programming Optimisation

Next steps might include:

 * Pseudo Boolean SAT

## Features

### Dummy variables

The two SAT encodings allow one to check for a complete stable matching. To
check for a largest-size stable matching, one can add dummy agents using
SMTI::add_dummy(). This adds one dummy agent to either side, each of which
finds all other agents equally acceptable. If adding *n-1* dummy agents results
in an unsatisfiable instance, but adding *n* dummy variables makes the
instances satisfiable, then the largest size stable matching has *n* unmatched
agents.



## Encoding types

### SAT

The SAT encoding produced is in DIMACS cnf form (see
[https://github.com/elffersj/roundingsat/blob/master/InputFormats.md](https://github.com/elffersj/roundingsat/blob/master/InputFormats.md)).

### Weighted Pseudo MaxSAT

The encoding is in a similar DIMACS form (see
[http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/requirements/](http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/requirements/)).

### Pseudo Boolean Optimisation

This uses the OPB format as described in
[https://github.com/elffersj/roundingsat/blob/master/InputFormats.md](https://github.com/elffersj/roundingsat/blob/master/InputFormats.md).
The objective in such an encoding is to minimise the number of agents who are
not matched.

### Integer programming optimisation

This actually calls CPLEX directly, but CPLEX creates an LP file as a
by-product.
The objective here is to maximise the number of matched pairs. This means that
the total number of matched agents is twice the objective.
